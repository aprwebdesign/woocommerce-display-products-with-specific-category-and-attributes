# woocommerce-display-products-with-specific-category-and-attributes

Page template to display products with specific attribute and from specific category.

Use for whatever you want, i just created this for a specific need creating lading pages on a website of a client.
To see the page template in action visit there [zwarte dames winterjassen](https://bkleder.nl/zwarte-dames-winterjassen/) page.

I will definitly use this (or a modified version) of this template for a lot of my future woocommerce projects.

If you have any comments on how to improve do let me know!
